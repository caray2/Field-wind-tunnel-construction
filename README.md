# Field-wind-tunnel-construction
Information for constructing a portable wind tunnel including multiple file types to increase accessibility

In this folder, there are multiple files that are compatible with different programs to aid you in constructing a wind tunnel. First, in the folder “pdfs.wind.tunnel.components” are three PDFs showing the relative sizes and shapes of the components used to build the tunnel. An Adobe Illustrator version of this file is in the main folder and is called “AlpineWindTunnel_component.dimensions.” Finally, there are two files called “AlpineWindTunnel _3D.components.” One is a “.f3d” file that is compatible with the computer aided design program, Autodesk Fusion. The other is a 3D object file (.stl) that was generated from the Autodesk Fusion file. This .stl file type is widely used and accepted by 3D printing programs.
